\section{Introduction}
The \href{http://datasketches.github.io/docs/ThetaSketchFramework.pdf}{Theta Sketch Framework}
encompasses many possible sketch algorithms only a few of which have been implemented in the 
Sketch Library.  
In this paper we will discuss the mathematics of the Bernoulli Sampling and KMV algorithms in some detail.  This should provide sufficient understanding of how these kinds of algorithms work.  For the analysis of the Alpha algorithm we will defer to the above TSF paper.
