\begin{abstract}
The math behind the sketch algorithms for unique counting has been well described in papers by Giroire\cite{Giroire2009}, Bar Yossef\cite{BarYossef} and many others.  
The presentation of these concepts in the theoretical research literature is often abstract with details deferred to other papers in order to save space. 
This makes acquiring intuitive understanding of these mathematical concepts a challenge if one is not familiar with this scientific discipline and its mathematical conventions.
The objective here is to develop the important mathematical concepts so that individuals with a background of first-year college calculus can follow them.
