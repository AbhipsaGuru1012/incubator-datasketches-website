#Sketch Origins

Sketching is a recent development in the field of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_algorithm"><i>Streaming Algorithms</i></a>[1]. 
Sketching has experienced a great deal of interest and growth since the mid 1990's coinciding with the growth of the Internet and the need to process and analyze 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">Big Data</a>.  The term <i>sketch</i>, with its allusion to an artist's sketch, has become the popular term to describe these algorithms and associated data structures that implement the theory.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Flajolet">Philippe Flajolet</a> 
is often refered to as the father of sketching with his research in analytic combinatorics and analysis of algorithms.  The 1985 paper 
<a href="http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/cs286/papers/flajoletmartin-jcss1985.pdf">
Probabilistic counting Algorithms for Data Base Applications</a> 
co-authored with G. Nigel Martin is one of the earliest papers that outlines the sketching concepts. 
The recent book, 
<a href="http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/cs286/papers/synopses-fntdb2012.pdf">
Synopses for Massive Data: Samples, Histograms, Wavelets, Sketches</a> by 
<a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/graham_cormode/">Graham Cormode</a>, et al, 
is an excellent review of this field.

Sketching is a synergistic blend of both theoretical mathematics and computer science that forms the foundations of "Stochastic Streaming Algorithms" or "Approximate Query Processing" and refers to a broad range of algorithms.
